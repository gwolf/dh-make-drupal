Description: Create Debian packages from Drupal modules and themes
 The purpose of this program is to generate Debian packages for any Drupal
 projects (that is, modules or themes).
 . 
 Given that Drupal developers publish their work through the main Drupal
 site (http://drupal.org), this program fetches the information for the
 latest available versions (for the right Drupal release, and with the
 specified stability level), and prepares a Debian package from it.
