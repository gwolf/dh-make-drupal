.SH NAME
dh-make-drupal - Builds a Debian package for the requested Drupal project
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dh-make-drupal
[options] project_name
.SH DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this program is to generate Debian packages for any Drupal
projects (that is, modules or themes). 

Given that Drupal developers publish their work through the main Drupal 
site (http://drupal.org), this program fetches the information for the
latest available versions (for the right Drupal release, and with the 
specified stability level), and prepares a Debian package from it.

This Debian package can be locally installed using 'dpkg', or uploaded to your
Apt repository.

Keep in mind that this package only goes as far as it can, being an automated 
tool. The generated packages will probably require verification/tweaking to
be of production quality.

This program has been inspired -and named in a similar fashion to- Debian's
pkg-perl group's dh-make-perl.
