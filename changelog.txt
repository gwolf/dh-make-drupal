1.2 (2012-08-13)
 * "Switch '-d' (Drupal version) was not accepting its needed argument.
   Fixed, thanks  to Matthew Gabeler-Lee for the report

1.1 (2012-06-28)
 * Fix a syntactic detail with optparse: The mandatory arguments for
   some options were not correctly declared, so the program didn't
   know what to do with them

1.0 (2012-06-15)
 * Use optparse (part of the Ruby standard library) instead of the
   (orphaned and Ruby 1.9-incompatible) CommandLine::Application
 * Default to Drupal 7 instead of 6
 * Protect some OpenURI calls avoiding ugly OpenURI::HTTPError
   exceptions

0.9 (2012-03-09)
 * Add the modules list for Drupal7
 * Updated the packaging style/compat level to debhelper 8, which led
   to some minor reorganizations

0.8 (2010-10-23)
 * Rework HPricot logic to cope with drupal.org's site reorganization
 * State that translation support is currently less-than-stellar :-(
   It should be brought back to level once the Debian release is
   done.

0.7 (2010-08-25)
 * Avoid dying with an exception if LICENSE.txt does not exist (thanks
   to Roel de Cock for the report)

 * Updated generated standards-version to 3.9.1.0

0.6 - 2010-04-15
 * Updated generated standards-version to 3.8.4
 * Builds a list of recommended modules/packages out of the
   submodules' *.info files (Debian bug #557116)
 * Now builds packages using the «3.0 (quilt)» source format

0.5 - 2009-12-24
 * Drupal.org page layout changed - The present changes made it work
   again :)

0.4 - 2009-06-26
 * Use the Debian email/fullname environment variables if they are
   found
 * Properly mangles -dev, -alpha, -beta, -rc version numbers with "~"
   character (double ~ for -dev) to properly sort them on Debian
 * Fixed bug which caused packages whose names include underscores to
   be built as debian-native packages

0.3 - 2009-02-27
 * Added dependency parsing/declaration for modules
 * Options are now handled through the DrupalProject::Options class,
   allowing for a cleaner flow and separation of concerns
 * Can also now start from a local tarball, no longer needs to fetch
   data from the Drupal website

0.2 - 2009-02-19
 * Updated release fetching code, due to a new webpage layout
 * Added the needed logic to also package translations

0.1 - 2009-02-16
